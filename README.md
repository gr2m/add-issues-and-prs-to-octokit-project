# add-issues-and-prs-to-octokit-project

> Internal utility script to update [the Octokit/JS project](https://github.com/orgs/octokit/projects/1)

This script loads all open issues and pull requests from all public JavaScript-related Octokit repositories in the [@octokit](https://github.com/octokit/) organization and add them to [the Octokit/JS project](https://github.com/orgs/octokit/projects/1).

It also normalizes labels across the same repositories.

I created it for a one-time use and future reference.
